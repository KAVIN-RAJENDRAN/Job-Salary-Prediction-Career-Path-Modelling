# Job-Salary-Prediction-Career-Path-Modelling

💼 Machine Learning project for predicting salaries and modeling career paths of data science professionals using Kaggle’s 2023 salary dataset. Includes Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM models integrated with a Flask backend and an interactive HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

This project focuses on analyzing real-world job market trends in the data science domain to predict salaries and model potential career growth. Using Kaggle’s Data Science Salaries 2023 dataset, the system applies multiple supervised machine learning algorithms — Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM (RBF Kernel) — to predict both continuous salary values and career path categories (Low, Medium, High).

The trained models are deployed through a Flask backend API, while a user-friendly frontend interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) allows real-time predictions based on user inputs such as experience level, job title, company size, and work location.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML integration — from data preprocessing and model comparison to full-stack deployment — providing insights into salary trends and career progression in the tech industry.
